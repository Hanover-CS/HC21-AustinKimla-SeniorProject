# ClientServer.py is meant to look for clients that are awaiting to find a connection and provide them with an IP like a DHCP server.
# Client.py is meant to accept that incoming connection and link up with the server via a handshake and provide a message saying connected and report details such as IP, hostname, etc.

# I would like to get it connecting to multiple clients over a network soon.
